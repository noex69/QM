# Visual Diffs

**Core guiding principle:** Someone unfamiliar with your project
(including you, some time later) should be able to look at your files,
understand what you did and why, and easily repeat it.

**Murphyâ€™s Law for computational projects:** For anything you do, you
will probably have to repeat it again later (new data, new parameters,
fixing bugs).

**General idea:** Breaking a lengthy workflow into pieces makes it
easier to understand, share, describe, and modify. Make your project
modular, and the modules transparent and reproducible. This is important
**for you and for others**.

**Fun fact:** Sticking to good practices in a scientific computational
project can save you a lot of time later, and make you (and others) a
happier person.
